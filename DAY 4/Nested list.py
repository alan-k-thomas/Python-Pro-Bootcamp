# Nested Lists
# We can put Lists inside other Lists, this becomes something called a "Nested List" or a "2D List". e.g.

Cricket = ["Virat", "Dhoni", "Sachin," "Rohith", "Bumrah"]
Football = ["Kp Rahul", "Sahal", "Ronaldo", "Messi", "Mbappe", "Salah"]
Sports_persons = [Cricket, Football]
print(Sports_persons)
